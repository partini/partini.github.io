Together with other panellists, Partin Imeri discussed in front of the audience about Web3, a technology that is shaping the future and the digital society. Web3 is considered as one of the pillars of the digital future and the technological revolution. Incodeks has already integrated Web 3.0 technologies into innovative products and services, and through the Albanian Developers conference a discussion space was provided to elaborate and further share with the IT community about them.
